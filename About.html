        and I am going to talk about my friend Christian.
         Where do I start? Oh, I know one thing I love about him is that he is very 
        understanding. For example, when someone is having a hard time he stops having
         fun just to go help the person in need. During recess we would only play soccer 
         and we were good. We would spend recess after recess playing soccer.</b>

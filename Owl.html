            <p>Facts I bet you did not know:</p>
            <p>1. So you might think Owls can turn their heads 360 degrees, right? Well, this is not exactly true. Yes,
                they can turn their heads quite a
                lot but, most Owls can turn their heads 270 degrees max. A specific owl called the Barred Owl can turn
                it's head just over 270 degrees.</p>

            <p>2. Did you know that there are over half the amount of species of owls than there are of dogs worldwide?
                Owls being at 236. Dogs being at 406!</p>

                    I know. Trust me, being a 10 year old kid, it was not easy but he made it fun. Day after day I would
                    come home
                    from school and learn so much from him and sometimes you don't even have to want to do it but just
                    taking your time to connect
                    with a person you love for as little as 20 minutes a day will really help you and the person your
                    with.
                    I learned that from him and I hope the person reading this will learn this to. Thanks, Papa.</b>
